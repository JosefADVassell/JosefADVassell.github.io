			<h2> Who I am </h2>
		</header>
		<p>I was born and raised in McAllen, Texas. From a young age, I have always enjoyed a challenge. When I started
			my university journey, my major was Exercise Science, but someone told me about computer science. I loved
			the idea of problem solving and having the ability to turn ideas into reality."
		</p>
		<header class="major">
			<h2> My Tech knowledge </h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			I have experience with C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and Dart. Java is my preferred language because of its
			string manipulation, object-oriented programming capabilities, and extensive documentation. When working on
			web applications, I use JavaScript due to its compatibility with Node.js and the React framework. I have
			used React in the past to create responsive web applications.

			For mobile applications, I prefer using Dart with the Flutter framework, where I am most efficient. I have
			also collaborated with a team to develop a mobile application that allows users to rent out technology. In
			this project, we opted for Firebase as our NoSQL database.

			During my time at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), I used the Azure platform to develop APIs that interact with
			the platform and affect users and groups in Azure.
		</p>
		<header class="major">
			<h2> What I am currently working on </h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			I am currently employed at PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) as a Cybersecurity Associate, where I am learning
			the fundamentals of cybersecurity. I have been deployed on projects where I use Microsoft Excel to verify
			data and identify correlations within the data. Additionally, I am gaining knowledge about Azure and its
			various services. Azure Key Vault is one of the first services I worked with, developing Java APIs that use
			Durable Functions to facilitate API calls, which interact with users and groups on the Azure platform.

			I am currently working towards obtaining the AWS Cloud Practitioner certificate, followed by the AWS
			Developer Associate certificate. AWS is becoming increasingly popular, and I believe that acquiring AWS
			skills will enhance my skill set and make me more versatile. Additionally, I have a keen interest in gaining
			skills in Artificial Intelligence.

				<h3>ASP.NET core</h3>
				<p>We used the ASP.NET Core framework to develop a travel web application. Our goal was to make it
					user-friendly for those who may not be tech-savvy, allowing them to input travel information such as
					trip duration, required fuel, and the number of days they need food for the journey. Our backend was
					powered by C#, and we used a SQL Server database.</p>

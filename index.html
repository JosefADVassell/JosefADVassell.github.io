			<h2> Who I am </h2>
		</header>
		<p>I was born and raised in McAllen, Texas. From a young age, I have always enjoyed a challenge. When I started
			my university journey, my major was Exercise Science, but someone told me about computer science. I loved
			the idea of problem solving and having the ability to turn ideas into reality.
		</p>
		<header class="major">
			<h2> My Tech knowledge </h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			I have experience with C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and Dart, which is very similar to JavaScript. Java is my
			preferred language due to its string manipulation, object-oriented programming, and comprehensive
			documentation. When working on web applications, I prefer JavaScript because of NodeJS, the React framework,
			and NextJS. I have used React to develop responsive web applications in the past. For mobile applications, I
			am efficient with Dart and the Flutter framework. I have collaborated on a team project to create a mobile
			application that allows users to rent out technology for money. Our team utilizes Firebase as the database,
			providing me with experience in working with various databases.

			During my time at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), I developed APIs on the Azure platform that interact with
			various technologies. I've also worked on projects involving different technologies.
		</p>
		<header class="major">
			<h2> What I am currently working on </h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			I am currently employed at PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) as a Cybersecurity Associate, where I am learning
			the fundamentals of cybersecurity. In my role, I have been deployed on projects using Microsoft Excel to
			verify data and identify correlations. Additionally, I am gaining knowledge about Azure and its various
			services. One of the first services I worked with is Azure Key Vault, where I developed Java APIs using
			Durable Functions to facilitate API calls, interacting with users and groups on the Azure platform.

			I am currently working to obtain the AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Developer Associate certifications. My
			goal is to develop an inventory project using NextJS with AWS DynamoDB as the database, building the project
			with Amazon Web Services as the backend. Learning AWS will enhance my skill set and make me more versatile.
			Additionally, I have a keen interest in acquiring skills in Artificial Intelligence.

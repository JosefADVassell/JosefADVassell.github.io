							<h2> Who I am </h2>
				        </header>
						<p>I was born and raised in Mcallen, Texas. From a young age, I have always enjoyed a challenge. When I start university my major was Exercise Science, but someone told me about computer science, and I love the idea of solving problems, and the ability to create.
						</p>
						<header class="major">	
						<h2> My Tech knowledge </h2>
					</header>
						<p>
							I have experience with C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and Dart. Java is my preferred language to use for its string manipulation, object-oriented programming, and it is documentation. If working on a web application I will use JavaScript, because of the NodeJS and the React framework. I have use React to make responsive web applications in the past. If I am working on mobile applications, I will use dart and the flutter framework where I am efficient. I have worked on a team to make a mobile application where you can rent out technology for money. Firebase is the database that our team uses, and I have gotten experience working with a database.
						</p>
						<header class="major">	
						<h2> Currently </h2>
					</header>
						<p>
							I am currently working to obtain AWS Certified Developer Associate, so I can learn how to use AWS cloud and develop a work ordering system Web applications for my current IT job for the ECISD district. My goal is to use Javascript and AWS Cloud as my database.

								<h3>ASP.NET core</h3>
								<p>ASP.NET core is the framework that we used to make a Travel web application. We wanted those who are not tech-savvy, to be able to input their traveling information like how long the trip is, how much gas is needed, how many days if you need food for the trip. Our back end was C# and the database was a SQL Server.</p>

								<a class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/gg4a.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Google Maps API</h3>
								<p>We implemented a Google Maps API, so when the user type in where they are going from start to end. With the distance information, the application will be able to calculate the amount of gas needed for the trip, the contribution for the mileage, and the best route to take for the trip.</p>
